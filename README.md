## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🏥 [Healthcare Geospatial Analytics](https://github.com/purva-kekan/healthcare-analytics-geospatial-analysis)
Built an end-to-end pipeline and **interactive geospatial dashboard** for Boston 311 service and health-related signals, combining Python, SQL, and ArcGIS to surface location-based risk patterns [cite:4][cite:14]. Deployed analytics in Power BI for non-technical stakeholders.

### 🧠 [Atomic Habits NLP + GenAI App](https://github.com/purva-kekan/atomichabits-nlp-project)
Developed an NLP + GenAI app using **Hugging Face LLMs, spaCy, and TF‑IDF clustering** to extract and visualize 50+ behavior patterns from “Atomic Habits” [cite:12][cite:13]. Delivered an end-to-end Streamlit experience from text ingestion to semantic network exploration.

### 🫁 [Respiratory Mortality ML System](https://github.com/purva-kekan/respiratory-mortality-system)
Implemented a production-style ML pipeline on 200K+ CDC records using **Prophet, LSTM, and geospatial features** to forecast respiratory mortality risk and surface city-level hotspots [cite:4]. Exposed model predictions via FastAPI with containerized deployment and monitoring.
