## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🏥 [Healthcare Geospatial Analytics](https://github.com/purva-kekan/healthcare-analytics-geospatial-analysis)
Built an end-to-end pipeline and **interactive geospatial dashboard** for Boston 311 service and health-related signals, combining Python, SQL, and ArcGIS to surface location-based risk patterns. Deployed analytics in Power BI for non-technical stakeholders.

### 🧠 [Atomic Habits NLP + GenAI App](https://github.com/purva-kekan/atomichabits-nlp-project)
Developed an NLP + GenAI app using **Hugging Face LLMs, spaCy, and TF‑IDF clustering** to extract and visualize 50+ behavior patterns from “Atomic Habits” [cite:13]. Delivered an end-to-end Streamlit experience from text ingestion to semantic network exploration.

### 🫁 [Respiratory Mortality ML System](https://github.com/purva-kekan/respiratory-mortality-system)
Implemented a production-style ML pipeline on 200K+ CDC records using **Prophet, LSTM, and geospatial features** to forecast respiratory mortality risk and surface city-level hotspots. Exposed model predictions via FastAPI with containerized deployment and monitoring.

## 📊 Experience (Snapshot)

**AI Analyst – IpserLab**  
- Build Python + SQL pipelines to clean, join, and transform multi-source trip data into analysis-ready feature sets for recommendation and safety models.  
- Partner with product and engineering to translate requirements into metrics, dashboards, and experiment designs for AI-powered trip search and planning.  
- Prototype and evaluate ML/NLP approaches, then hand off production-ready logic to engineering for integration into user-facing flows.

**Data & Analytics – Boston Public Health Commission / Kids At Risk Action (KARA - NGO) (Company Sponsored Capstone Projects)**  
- Analyzed 60K+ public health records to build forecasting and cohort analyses that support program planning and operational decisions.  
- Designed and maintained Power BI/Tableau dashboards to monitor KPIs for clinics, programs, and population health initiatives.  
- Collaborated with cross-functional teams to define data requirements, validate data quality, and document metric definitions.

**Data & Analytics – HDFC Bank Ltd**  
- Developed SQL-based ETL and reporting for 100K+ customer and account records, improving data quality and reducing manual reporting effort.  
- Built dashboards and ad-hoc analyses for risk, compliance, and product teams to track portfolio performance and customer behavior.  
- Worked with stakeholders to prioritize analytics requests, refine requirements, and iterate on dashboard and report designs.
