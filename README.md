## 👋 About Me

AI Analyst specializing in **LLMs, RAG systems, and production ML infrastructure**. Currently building **CAVO** at IpserLab—an AI-powered travel platform leveraging retrieval-augmented generation and recommendation systems.

I design and deploy **end-to-end AI/ML solutions**: from ETL pipelines and feature engineering to model deployment with Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS. Previous experience includes data engineering at **HDFC Bank** (India's largest private bank, 500K+ records) and advanced analytics at **Northeastern University** (3.93 GPA).

**Seeking:** AI Engineer | ML Engineer | Data Scientist roles focused on LLMs, MLOps, and production AI systems

📍 **Boston, MA | Open to Relocation Across US**
