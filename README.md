## 🎯 About Me

**Data Analyst @ Ipserlab** | Passionate about transforming raw data into actionable insights that drive meaningful change

I'm a recent graduate with a Master's in Analytics (GPA: 3.93/4.0) from Northeastern University, specializing in **data storytelling, behavioral analytics, and equity-driven solutions**. Currently driving 40% higher student engagement in mental health through NLP-powered behavioral analytics at Ipserlab.

🔍 **What drives me:** Using data + behavioral science to address real-world equity challenges in healthcare and community outcomes

🚀 **Currently building:** [CAViO](https://github.com/purva-kekan) - an inclusive AI-driven travel platform

🌟 **Beyond analytics:** When I'm not diving into data, you'll find me dancing, designing, or exploring creative ways to visualize insights
